# Stwitter (Simple Twitter)

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to use queues, edge services, Feign, caching, config servers, and service registries.

## Stwitter

Stwitter (Simple Twitter) is a stripped down social media service. The project was started as a proof of concept and the management team now wants you to complete the system for use on the company intranet.
